# Boids Algorithm

A simple simulation of flocking behavior using the classic Boids rules.

## Overview
The Boids algorithm simulates flocking using three core rules:

1. **Separation** – avoid crowding neighbors  
2. **Alignment** – match velocity with nearby boids  
3. **Cohesion** – steer toward the group’s center
